Automated Water Supply Management for Filtration Systems
Project Overview
This project details the design and conceptual implementation of an automated water supply management system for household water purifiers. The system intelligently controls the transfer of raw water (specifically from an AC outlet collection point) to a purifier and then to a purified water storage tank, ensuring optimal levels and preventing manual intervention, overflows, or dry runs.

The Problem Solved
Traditional water purification often involves manual refilling of the purifier's input tank or monitoring the output tank to prevent overflow. This system addresses these inefficiencies by providing a fully automated solution that ensures continuous operation of the purifier and prevents common issues associated with manual management. It's particularly useful for situations where raw water is collected intermittently, such as from an AC outlet.

System Design & Operation
The system is engineered for autonomous operation, relying on precise water level monitoring to control a pump.

Core Functionality:

Intelligent Water Sourcing: Monitors the water level in the raw water collection container (e.g., water collected from an AC outlet). The system initiates pumping only when a sufficient amount of raw water has accumulated.

Purified Water Level Management: Monitors the water level in the purified water storage tank. This prevents overfilling and ensures the pump stops when the tank is full.

Automated Pumping Cycle: A controlled pump transfers water from the raw water source to the purifier.

Fail-Safe Mechanism: The system automatically deactivates the pump if the raw water source runs dry or if the purified water tank reaches its capacity, protecting the pump and preventing spills.

Conceptual Architecture
The system's architecture is built around a central microcontroller that orchestrates the water flow based on sensor inputs.

Input Water Level Sensing: A sensor detects the presence of raw water at a specific level in the input container.

Output Water Level Sensing: Another sensor detects the fill level of the purified water storage tank.

Control Logic: A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Nano) continuously reads these sensor states.

Pump Actuation: Based on the logic (raw water available AND purified tank not full), the microcontroller activates or deactivates the water pump.

Key Components & Hardware
Microcontroller: Arduino Nano (for control logic and sensor integration)

Water Pump: (e.g., a small DC submersible pump for water transfer)

Pump Driver/Relay Module: (Essential for safely interfacing the high-current pump with the low-current microcontroller)

Water Level Sensors (x2): (e.g., float switches, conductive sensors, or non-contact sensors)

One for the raw water input container.

One for the purified water output tank.

Power Supply: Dedicated power sources for the microcontroller and the pump (as pumps often require more power).

Interconnects: Wires, breadboard (for prototyping)

Optional: Status LED (for visual indication of pump operation).
